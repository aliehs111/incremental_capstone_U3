Overview
Building upon the previous capstone work, which focused on data aggregation, cleaning, processing, and visualization, this phase aims to develop machine learning models to predict hourly bike rental counts. The project will cover feature engineering, scaling, and regression modeling techniques to build an effective predictive model.

Project Statement

Develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to forecast hourly bike rentals using various regression techniques and performance evaluation methods

Input dataset: DatasetLinks to an external site.

Steps to Perform

Task 1: Feature engineering (45 mins)

 Analyze the provided dataset and select relevant features
Create new features such as: 
Interaction features
Encode categorical variables and handle missing values
Scale the numerical features using StandardScaler
Save the processed dataset as "bike_rental_features.csv"
      Task 2: Model building (75 mins)

Implement various regression models including: 
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
Elastic Net Regression
 Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Evaluate model performance using: 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
      Task 3: Model building with polynomial features (45 mins)

Create polynomial features for selected numerical columns
Train models with polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships
Compare results with linear models to assess improvements
Save the best-performing model
      Task 4: Model evaluation and validation (45 mins)

Perform cross-validation techniques to validate model performance (on both models- With Polynomial Features and without Polynomial Features)
Assess models using test data
Compare results across different regression models
      Task 5: Reporting and insights (30 mins)

1.    Summarize findings and key takeaways from the analysis
2.    Discuss feature importance and business implications
3.    Provide recommendations for further improvements
